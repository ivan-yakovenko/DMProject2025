# Discrete Mathematics Project

## Overview

---

This project focuses on testing the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest paths between source and its destinations on graphs, represented by adjacency matrix and adjacency lists.

---

## Project structure 

The project repository consists of a directory called [**src**](src/), containing one subdirectory [**GraphStructures**](src/GraphStructures/) with different graph representations:

- [**Graph representation as adjacency matrix**](src/GraphStructures/GraphAdjM)
- [**Graph representation as adjacency lists**](src/GraphStructures/GraphAdjL)

*Detailed README for graph structures representations:* [***see***](src/GraphStructures/GraphsRepresentations.md)   

and two executable files:

- [**Executable for graph representation as adjacency matrix**](src/GraphAdjMexec.cpp)
- [**Executable for graph representation as adjacency lists**](src/GraphAdjLexec.cpp)

with the implementation of **Edros-Renyi** and **Bellman-Ford** algorithms and tests required.

*Detailed README for executables/algorithms implementations:* [***see***](src/Algorithms.md)
